This is an implementation of invokedynamic-based multi-language linking and
metaobject protocol framework. Such framework allows JVM classes emitted by
one language runtime to invoke methods, read and write properties, and so
forth, on objects from a different language runtime, within a single JVM
instance.

See the [User guide](https://github.com/szegedi/dynalink/wiki) and the
[Javadoc](http://szegedi.github.com/dynalink/0.2/javadoc/index.html) for details
on the last released version (0.2). Both are fairly comprehensive and should get 
you started quickly.

You can also check the [User guide](https://github.com/szegedi/dynalink/wiki/Home-0.3)

next, not yet released version (0.3) if you're interested in the bleeding edge.
