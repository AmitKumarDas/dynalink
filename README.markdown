This is an implementation of invokedynamic-based multi-language linking and
metaobject protocol framework. Such framework allows JVM classes emitted by
one language runtime to invoke methods, read and write properties, and so
forth, on objects from a different language runtime, within a single JVM
instance.

See the [User guide](https://github.com/szegedi/dynalink/wiki) and the
[Javadoc](http://szegedi.github.com/dynalink/javadoc/index.html) for details.
Both are fairly comprehensive and should get you started quickly.
