Dynalink is an invokedynamic-based high-level linking and metaobject 
protocol library. It enables creation of languages on the JVM that can 
easily interoperate with plain Java objects and each other.

It lets you write your language runtime in a way where you can think in
higher-level abstractions than the invokedynamic bytecode instruction.

See the [Online documentation](https://github.com/szegedi/dynalink/wiki) to 
get started.

You can also check out the [video](http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/1113272541001)
of the talk given on Dynalink on the 2011 JVM Language Summit.

If you just want the binaries, you can get the releases from the 
[Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C-362742625). 
Frequent snapshots of the version under development are available in the [
Maven snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/dynalang/dynalink).
