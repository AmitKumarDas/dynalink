Dynalink is an invokedynamic-based high-level linking and metaobject 
protocol library. It enables creation of languages on the JVM that can 
easily interoperate with plain Java objects and each other.

It lets you write your language runtime in a way where you can think in
higher-level abstractions than the invokedynamic bytecode instruction.

See the [User guide](https://github.com/szegedi/dynalink/wiki/User-Guide-0.3) and the
[Javadoc](http://szegedi.github.com/dynalink/0.3/javadoc/index.html) for details
on the last released version (0.3). Both are fairly comprehensive and should get 
you started quickly.

You can also check out the [video](http://medianetwork.oracle.com/media/show/17012)
of the talk given on Dynalink on the 2011 JVM Language Summit.

If you just want the binaries, you can get them from the 
[Maven repository](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C-362742625).
