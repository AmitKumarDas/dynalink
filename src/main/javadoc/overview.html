    <title>Dynamic Linker Framework for Languages on the JVM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is an implementation of invokedynamic-based multi-language linking
      and metaobject protocol framework. Such framework allows JVM classes
      emitted by one language runtime to invoke methods, read and write
      properties, and so forth, on objects from a different language runtime,
      within a single JVM instance. As a special case, it can be conveniently
      used to manipulate POJOs from non-Java language runtimes running on the
      JVM.
